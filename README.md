<h1>Project Overview</h1>
This project, titled Amazon Prime Video Data Analysis Dashboard, presents an end-to-end data analysis and visualization solution built using Microsoft Power BI. The objective of this project is to analyze Amazon Prime Video’s content catalog, explore its global distribution, and understand patterns across genres, release years, countries, and content types (Movies and TV Shows).

By leveraging Power Query for data cleaning and transformation, along with DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations, this project demonstrates how raw data can be converted into meaningful business insights. The final interactive dashboard provides a clear, data-driven picture of Amazon Prime Video’s content diversity, growth trends, and strategic content distribution over time.
